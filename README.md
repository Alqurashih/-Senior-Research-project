#  Senior Research project
Project Discription:

Transit agencies should be able to plan well in advance to develop accurate customer schedules. But Most transit agencies are always faced with uncertainties while planning for their customer travel schedule due to certain conditions such as unfavourable weather patterns, long lead times, the occurrence of special events on a customer route, impromptu en-route service for instance repairing of roads or electricity. This project is going to develop a tool that will allow these transit agencies to provide its customers with timely and accurate schedules information on a website. This project will be base on an open source platform.
